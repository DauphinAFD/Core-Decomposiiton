# Core-Decomposiiton

Here I have Implemented Core Decomposition using a Master Thesis [K-Core Decomposition with CUDA](https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2720504/Master_Thesis_done.pdf?sequence=1) in CUDA C/C++. The Results show that the Computational speed is much faster than the respective sequential Implementation.
